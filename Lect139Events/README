Procedural driver program VS Event Driven program.

Console programs, or any without a user interface are PROCEDURE DRIVEN, 
which means that they run from the entry point of the application to the last line of code. 
Even the existence of conditional blocks, they are supposed to follow an order.

UI applications are EVENT DRIVEN, that's because the users actions dictates what code will be run and when.

Typically the life cycle of a UI is as follows:
1. It'll run the initialization code
2. It'll then build the main user interface
3. And then it'll wait for user input

4. When the user takes one action, the application will run the code that handles that particular event
5. When the user closes the main window, or indicates some other way that they'd like to close the application, 
then a cleanup code will run and the application will then exit at that point. 

In JavaFx the "JavaFx application thread" or "UI Thread" waits for user input

Controller.java : is the part of the application that handles user input.

We've writen an EventHandler and associated it with out button, 
when we click the button the UI thread to see if there's an EventHandler for that particular event.

Another way of saying that an application is interested in handling our event 
is saying that "it's listening for an event" and for that reason EventHandlers are sometimes 
referred as EventListeners and we'll see that terminology in Android for instance. 

@FXML
private TextField nameField;

indicates that this field will be associated to the element with the same name in the fxml.

Annotations in EventHandler or EventListeners

@FXML
public void onButtonClicked(){...}

are not mandatory but are helpfull, kinda like a comment.
